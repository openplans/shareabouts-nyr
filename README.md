Shareabouts for NY Rising

Map updates 
------------


Updating the map involves the following steps:

* Updating the tiles
* Transferring corridor names to the roadway segments
* Updating attributes for the assets
* Combining roads and assets into a single geojson

Step by step:

0. PB will send over new shapefiles for assets and overlays. Save the zip here in Dropbox:

  `projects/150 NY Rising/data/assets/originals from PB/DATE RW_Assets`
 
0. Open TileMill and remove the asset and overlay layers. Keep the css. If you don't do this, TileMill may freak out when the files change.

0. Make a new dated asset folder. Unzip and move the new shapefiles into it like this:

  `projects/150 NY Rising/data/assets/RE/20131029`

0. Check the new files:
  
   -- Any zero or null IDs?
   
   -- Do they open in qgis and look ok?
   
   -- Anything that's not going to work on the map?

0. Update TileMill -- add in `assets` and `overlay` layers using the new shapefiles. Move them below buildings. Order: #studyarea, #overlay, #building, #assets, #street, #counties, #shoreline. Export the new tiles.

0. __Copy__ the road segment file from the previous dated asset folder, into the `to merge` subdirectory e.g from `assets/RE/20131018/to merge/roadbed.shp` to `assets/RE/20131029/to merge/road.shp`.

0. In gqis, make sure the segments beneath the corridors/overlay shapes are updated with the correct name. Check for any segments that need to be split or drawn in. Set `ASSET_CLAS` to `ROAD` for anything new, copy over `Zone` and `ASSET` too.

0. Move anything that should be clickable into its own shapefile in `to merge`:

  -- For RW, put `ROCKAWAY BOARDWALK` into its own file.

0. From assets, select `ASSET_CLAS is null`, update to `NONE`. Copy the assets shapefile into `to merge`.

0. Run `Merge shapefiles into one`. 

0. TODO: merging

0. TODO: numbering the roadways etc -- do we need to do this? how will I pull out the road sections that have been updated?
